# Tests

testing is incredibly important. 

please try to get all tests passing while breaking the code, and add a test that fixes that. you'll be very cool if you do. 

### How to run?

You can run all tests in your terminal by going into the root folder and entering

```bash
python -m pytest
```

or you can run one individually

```bash
python tests/test_ops.py
```
